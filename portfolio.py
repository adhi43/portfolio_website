 Adarsh Anil is a male who is 23 years old. He has a girlfriend named Jasmine whom he loves the most and i ready to do anything. She is 22 Years old. She is christian 
 and Adarsh is a Hindu. So for their relationship lot of problems are there. Now also she is trying to break up with him without even giving him a last chance. She is not
 realisation how much adarsh loved her(Jasmine). She is Adaarsh's world.  Adarsh proposed Jasmine and both become in relationship. Jasmine took care of Adarsh as a small child, took care 
 of him always, always possessive about him and all. Seeing this Adarsh thought jasmine will never leave him and will marry each other. in this realationship both had many
 problems and happy moments. Adarsh truly loved her but slowly slowly jasmine thought adarsh is not loving her anymore as she thought adarsh changed but adarsh didnt changed 
 the love was not been expressed upto the extend Jasmine wanted. Jasmine used to put her emotions and all in her heart itself which became full of grudges in her heart towards adarsh slowly. Now today
 Jasmine wants breakup from Adarsh. Adarsh is heartbroken doesnt want to leave her at any cose. but jasmine is saying she had given many chances for Adarsh but Adarsh didnt changed. 
 Jasmine is saying she has lost trust in him. But ADarsh is now sturn in his decision that he will damly change for sure as he will become a boyfriend jasmine decides. but jasmine is not accepting it she thinks adarsdh is bluffing 
 and adarshg doesnt know what to do next to get back his precious gem(Jasmine) into his life. adarsh is literally puzzled at this moment. Adrsh at any cost wants his love. Adarsh is ready
 to do whatever inorder to gain Jasmine.  
 
 
 Adarsh has loved Jasmine with every part of his being. He never imagined a life without her in it. The thought of her leaving is something that cuts deeper than words can describe. He’s always tried to be the person she could rely on, someone who would never let her down. Jasmine is more than just someone he loves—she’s the one who has made his world feel alive.

Every laugh, every conversation, every shared moment has become a part of his soul. Adarsh has given his heart to her without hesitation, and the thought of losing her... well, it’s not something he can easily accept. He wants to make her understand how much she truly means to him. Without her, it feels like a part of him is missing, and he fears that walking away might be something he could never truly recover from.

Adarsh just hopes, somehow, that Jasmine will see the depth of his love and choose to stay, because without her, life won’t be the same."
